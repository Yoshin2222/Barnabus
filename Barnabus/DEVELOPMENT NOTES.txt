;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; DEVELOPMENT NOTES ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;;;;;;;;;;;;; MISCELLANIOUS TIDBITS ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;- Standing/Crouching Gethits are usually 3 frames apeice, with maybe 1 additional frame for
;making the return to idle a tad smoother. Sprite by preferrence

;- Depending on how the frames are drawn, 5040,0/10/20 can reuse sprites from 5030, as wel as reuse
;srpties in 5040 itself. For example, Norokos Sprite 5040,0 and 5040,20 use the same sprite,
;Ananzi simply rotates 5010,10 left and uses it for both 5030,20 and slightly edits it for
;5040,0.

;- Killer Mode is enabled with a kick and punch, but both
;Buttons must be of the same Strength. It costs 2 bars, and can be
;Cancelled at any time using the same inputs, and is usually around the
;State 3000 range

;- Fatal Moves cost 3 bars, and the Opponent must be at 1/3 of their
;health. The input changes from character to character, but is typically
;a QCF/B motion followed by 2P/K

;- Light Normals can be cancelled in to each other in a string of 3. This
;Is true for air normals as well, with standing and crouching normals
;being capable of cancelling in to each other

;- Heavy normals can cancel in to each other, but the specifics vary.
;Animus can cancel in to HK from HP, Shar Makai can't at all, Hashi can from
;CR.HK in to CR.HP, etc. Use as suitable for the character ya making

;- Characters typically have a move that launches, but Shar Makai is an
;outlier. This move is often times CR.HP, but this can also vary. When
;connecting with a move that launches, note that this can only be
;done once per combo, as subsequent connects cause the opponent to fall
;quickly, assumedly as a form of IPS. This property needn't be exclusive to
;Normals, as moves such as Shar Makais QCB+2Ps initial hit has the
;same property

;- Light Normals can cancel in to Heavy Normals, the only exception being 
;that Shar Makai cannot cancel in to Standing Heavy normals from
;Crouching light normals

;- Supers can typically be cancelled in to from Special moves, without exception
;as far as I know

;- You CANNOT combo after throws. The only exception to this being Shar
;Makais back throw, which can be followed up as if it were a launcher,
;without actually limiting launching attacks. Seeing as every other throw
;Is incapable of being extended, a part of me writes this off as an error.

;- Var(10) is widely used in the cast to check if Killer Mode is on. This is
;especially important in the case of AI. As long as this var is used to check if
;the mode is active, whether as a whole or via a Bit Check, Var(10)
;MUST be used to toggle Killer Mode to ensure compatibility with the cast.
;NOTE: While the mode is active, you don't gain meter. This is done in
;each hitdef by writing
;Getpower = value*!var(10)

;- AI gets more difficult as the arcade run progresses. It starts off as LVL1,
;increasing to LVL2 after the 3rd match, and increasing to LVL3 
;after the 5th. AI is handled in -1

;- Anim 9999 is typically used for the Super Background of the character

;--------- HASHI ---------;
;91250 - Hashi Fatal
;EXAMPLE ANIM
;[Begin Action 91250]
;First frame shows nothing from the
;neck up, the next has the char
;cut in half. Usually uses an edited 5062,10
;frame as the base of both sprites. Alligned at around
;the mid point
;9125,10, 0,0, 100
;9125,11, 0,0, 98

;--------- PEKETO ---------;
;State 912320 should be in YOUR CHARACTERS FILES. This is because Peketo checks if
;anim 91230 exists, and if it does, to cut the characters head off. State 912320
;itself is what happens to the head when it's cut off, allowing for custom behaviour
;such as Animus laughing

;EXAMPLE ANIMS
; Peketo Fatal - Held
;[Begin Action 91230]
;5031,0, 0,0, 60
;9123,10, 0,0, 200

; Peketo Fatal - Fall
;[Begin Action 91231]
;9123,11, 0,0, 6

;9123,13, 0,0, 4
;9123,14, 0,0, -1

; Peketo Fatal - Decapitated Head
;[Begin Action 912320]
;9123,20, 0,0, 5
;9123,21, 0,0, 5
;9123,22, 0,0, 5

;9123,24, 0,0, 5
;9123,25, 0,0, 5
;9123,26, 0,0, 5

; Peketo Fatal - Head hit cground
;[Begin Action 912321]
;9123,28, 0,0, 3
;9123,29, 0,0, -1

;9213,10-12 are typically just edited 5031,0, 10 and 20
;9213,13-14 are simply reused Ground Hit frames, just with t0he head removed, I perso0nally
;suggest 5040,0 and 10, but use whatever works best.
;9213,20-27 can be made easier to make by taking any given upright gethit head,
;rotating it by 45 degrees, and repeating the 2 frames, rotating by 90
;degrees to get a full rotation
;9213,28-29 are the frames used for when the head hits the ground

;--------- ANIMUS ---------;
;9124,10 is simply an edited 5031,0 frame but with the legs missing. The same
;process is also done for 9124,11 using 5041,10. 9124,20/21 are used for the legs
;when they're sent flying, the first frame for when in mid-air, the latter for when it
;hits the ground. Typically 5031,20 is used as the base for the first frame, and 5041,10
;uis used for the latter as well
